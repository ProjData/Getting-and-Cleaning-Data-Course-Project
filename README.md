# Purpose of Repository

This repository contains my submission for the Peer-graded Assignment: **Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**. 

The primary task involved transforming a provided dataset into a **clearer, tidy data set** suitable for further analysis and research. This process included data cleaning, structuring and taking the averages of all variables to ensure the dataset is more accessible and easier to work with.

# Files in Repository

- `run_analysis.R`: This script loads and transforms raw data to create a tidy dataset named `tidyDataSet`.
- `CodeBook.md`: A code book describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
